# Machine-Learning
Loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithm on the data. Used the following algorithms to build the models:  
k-Nearest Neighbor, 
Decision Tree, 
Support Vector Machine, 
Logistic Regression,

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:
Jaccard index,
F1-score,
LogLoass,
